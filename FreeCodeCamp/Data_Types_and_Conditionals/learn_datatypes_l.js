/* The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It is used to evaluate a condition and return a value based on the result of the condition:

Syntax is: let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
In the above example, if the condition is true, the value of result will be value1. Otherwise, the value of result will be value2. */
